    <p><strong>RTB</strong> may refer to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A [github profile](https://github.com/rtullybarr).</li>
      <li>A [substack](https://spaceinvader55.substack.com/). There's not much there, and it's <em>pretty weird</em>. You've been warned.</li>
      <li>A [bluesky](space55invader.bsky.social)</li>
      <li>An upcoming [photography project], not yet deployed.</li>
      <li>This very website, which I've decided to call <em>return to basics</em>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There's not much here yet. Consider this to be an under-construction linking of a number of my artistic and technological experiments.</p>
    <p>Inspirations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Wikipedia's disambiguation page (clearly);</li>
      <li>The minimalist design of motherfuckingwebsite.com and bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com (and also [words](https://justinjackson.ca/words.html) for less satire and more heart.)</li>
